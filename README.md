# Hello World! (WAR-style)

This is the simplest possible Java webapp for testing servlet container deployments. It should work on any container and requires no other dependencies or configuration.

Now also supports Docker to run the WAR-file in a Tomcat container! Find the deployed container at `http://<your-server>/hello-world`
